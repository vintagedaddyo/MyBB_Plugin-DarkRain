To install, just copy the files from the ZIP-archive into the right directory of your server and activate the Plugin in the admin control panel.

Compatibility
MyBB 1.8: Yes

Because this plugin places a dark canvas in the background it modifies the background properties of body #logo and #content...., it also overrides font color for those as well as for .navigation .active and .navigationâ€¦,

body and #content are marked as !important for override but I left #logo without !important so that if you are using the color_whatever.css in say the default theme you can go into say for example color_black.css and find #logo and mark as !important to override

ie:

Change:

#logo {
    background: #202020 url(images/colors/black_header.png) top left repeat-x;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #000;
}


To:

#logo {
    background: #202020 url(images/colors/black_header.png) top left repeat-x !important;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #000;
}
